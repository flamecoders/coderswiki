## Java Variables
Variables are containers for storing data values.

In Java, there are different types of variables, for example:
`String` - stores text, such as "Hello". String values are surrounded by double quotes
`int` - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123
`float` - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99
`char` - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes
`boolean` - stores values with two states: true or false

## Declaring (Creating) Variables
To create a variable, you must specify the type and assign it a value:
```bash
type variableName=value;
```
Where type is one of Java types (such as int or String), and variableName is the name of the variable (such as x or name). The equal sign is used to assign values to the variable.

To create a variable that should store text, look at the following example:
Example
Create a variable called name of type String and assign it the value "John":
```bash
String name = "John";
System.out.println(name);

```
To create a variable that should store a number, look at the following example:
```bash
int myNum = 15;
System.out.println(myNum);
```
You can also declare a variable without assigning the value, and assign the value later:
Example
```bash
int myNum;
myNum = 15;
System.out.println(myNum);
```
Note that if you assign a new value to an existing variable, it will overwrite the previous value:
Example Change the value of myNum from 15 to 20:
```bash
int myNum = 15;
myNum = 20;  // myNum is now 20
System.out.println(myNum);
```
## Final Variables
If you dont want others (or yourself) to overwrite existing values, use the final keyword (this will declare the variable as "final" or "constant", which means unchangeable and read-only):
Example
```bash
final int myNum = 15;
myNum = 20;  // will generate an error: cannot assign a value to a final variable
```

## Other Types
A demonstration of how to declare variables of other types:
Example
```bash
int myNum = 5;
float myFloatNum = 5.99f;
char myLetter = 'D';
boolean myBool = true;
String myText = "Hello";
```
